Founded on the intersection of synthetic biology \nand forestry, LifeForest is a \"Living Data Bank\" that encodes human history, art, and personal \nlegacies into the DNA of ancient-growth tree species.\nThe Bio-Silicon Revolution\nThe company’s breakthrough lies in its DNA-Encapsulation Technology. Using CRISPR-based \nsequencing, LifeForest converts binary data—photos, videos, and text—into four-base genetic \ncode ($A, C, G, T$). This code is synthesized and integrated into the non-coding regions of a \nsapling’s genome, allowing the tree to act as a permanent, self-replicating hard drive that grows \nwith time.\nEcosystem Features:\nThe Eternal Grove: Customers can plant a \"Memory Tree\" in protected global sanctuaries. As the \ntree grows, the data remains protected within its cellular structure, shielded from electromagnetic \npulses or hardware failure.\nArbor-Retrieval Kits: Using a non-invasive leaf-sampling tool, future generations can sequence a \nsmall portion of the tree’s foliage to decode and view the stored \"ancestral\" data.\nSymbiotic Maintenance: The revenue from data storage is funneled directly into global \nreforestation eﬀorts, making LifeForest the world’s ﬁrst carbon-negative data center.\nLifeForest isn't just a storage solution; it is a bridge between the digital present and a sustainable, \nbiological future.
